# Advanced Physics Simulation

This chapter covers advanced physics simulation techniques that integrate Gazebo with Unity for complex humanoid robot simulation environments. These techniques go beyond basic physics simulation to provide more sophisticated simulation capabilities that better match real-world complexities.

## Topics Covered

1. [Compliant Contact Models](./compliant-contact-models.md) - Learn about compliant contact models for realistic interactions in Gazebo
2. [Friction Models](./friction-models.md) - Explore advanced friction models including static, dynamic, and viscous friction
3. [Multi-Body Dynamics](./multi-body-dynamics.md) - Understand complex joint constraints and multi-body dynamics
4. [Physics-Unity Integration](./physics-unity-integration.md) - Techniques for integrating Gazebo physics with Unity visualization
5. [Advanced Physics Examples](./advanced-physics-examples.md) - Practical implementations and examples of advanced physics techniques

Advanced physics simulation is critical for high-fidelity digital twins, providing the realistic interactions necessary for accurate humanoid robot testing and development.
