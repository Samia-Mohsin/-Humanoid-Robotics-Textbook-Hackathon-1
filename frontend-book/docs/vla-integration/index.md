# Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Humanoid Robotics Textbook! This module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robotics, focusing on how vision, language, and action components integrate to enable autonomous behavior.

## Chapters

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### Chapter 1: VLA System Overview
Learn about the Vision-Language-Action architecture and how vision, language, and action components work together in humanoid robots to achieve autonomy.

### Chapter 2: Language to Intent
Explore how language inputs are processed to generate intent for humanoid robots, including conceptual understanding of voice-to-text conversion and how Large Language Models (LLMs) understand tasks and create plans.

### Chapter 3: Planning to Action
Understand how high-level intents and plans are translated into specific ROS 2 actions for humanoid robots, including the complete flow from language command to physical action execution.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the Vision-Language-Action architecture and its components
- Describe how language commands are processed to generate intent
- Understand the translation of high-level plans into ROS 2 actions
- Trace the complete flow from voice command to physical action execution
- Identify the role of VLA systems in humanoid autonomy
