Welcome to **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**, a comprehensive guide designed for AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics.

## Getting Started

This educational module will guide you through **ROS 2 fundamentals for humanoid robotics** in a structured learning path:

- **ROS 2 Basics**: Understanding the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots and DDS concepts
- **Communication Model**: Learning nodes, topics, services, and practical rclpy examples
- **Robot Structure**: Understanding URDF for humanoid robots and simulation readiness

### What you'll learn

- Core concepts of ROS 2 and why it matters for humanoid robotics
- How to implement communication patterns with nodes, topics, and services
- How to define robot structure using URDF for humanoid robots
- Practical examples using rclpy for agent and controller implementations

## About ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the middleware nervous system that connects various components of humanoid robotic systems. Unlike traditional approaches, ROS 2 provides a flexible, distributed framework that enables:

- **Decentralized communication** through a publish-subscribe model
- **Language independence** supporting Python, C++, and other languages
- **Real-time capabilities** essential for humanoid robot control
- **Scalability** from single robots to multi-robot systems

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is structured to build your knowledge incrementally. Start with the ROS 2 basics and progress through communication models to robot structure. Each section includes practical examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.
