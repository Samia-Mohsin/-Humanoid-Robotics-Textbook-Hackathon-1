# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Humanoid Robotics Textbook! This module covers the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for humanoid robotics, focusing on perception, navigation, and training concepts.

## Chapters

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Overview
Learn about the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, including the differences between Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, and the role of simulation and synthetic data in AI development.

### Chapter 2: Perception and Navigation
Explore Visual SLAM (VSLAM) concepts, sensor pipeline architectures, and integration with ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) for humanoid robots.

### Chapter 3: Training and Readiness
Understand path planning algorithms for humanoid robots and techniques for bridging the gap between simulation and real-world deployment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS capabilities and use cases
- Explain how visual SLAM enables simultaneous localization and mapping
- Describe how sensor data flows through pipelines to enable navigation
- Understand basic path planning algorithms and their applications
- Identify challenges and techniques for simulation-to-real transfer
