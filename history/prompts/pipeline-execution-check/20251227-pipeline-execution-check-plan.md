## Response

Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Pipeline Execution Summary and Result Analysis feature in branch `001-pipeline-execution-check`. The planning includes:

**Phase 0 - Research:**
- Analyzed existing pipeline execution flow in main.py
- Identified key implementation areas for enhancement
- Resolved all technical unknowns and research requirements

**Phase 1 - Design & Contracts:**
- Created comprehensive data model with entities: PipelineExecutionSummary, ExecutionResult, and PerformanceMetrics
- Developed detailed contract for execution summary format
- Created quickstart guide for implementation
- Updated agent context with new technology stack information
- Generated all required documentation artifacts

**Key Artifacts Created:**
- Implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
- Research document (research.md) with technical approach and alternatives
- Data model (data-model.md) with entity definitions and validation rules
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for developers
- API contract (contracts/execution-summary-contract.md) defining summary format
- Updated agent context in CLAUDE.md

The plan enhances the existing pipeline execution summary to provide comprehensive metrics and validation as specified in the feature requirements, maintaining full compliance with the project constitution and building on the existing backend infrastructure.
