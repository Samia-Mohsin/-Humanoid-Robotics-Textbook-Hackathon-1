prompt_text: |
  -Set up Module-2 in Docusaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations (physics, environments, sensors).

  -All content written as .md files, organized per chapter for easy navigation.
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Advanced Digital Twin Integration module. Key accomplishments:

  1. Created comprehensive implementation plan (plan.md) with:
     - Technical context defining TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C# technologies
     - Constitution check confirming all principles satisfied
     - Project structure for Docusaurus-based documentation
     - Complexity tracking and post-design evaluation

  2. Generated research document (research.md) covering:
     - Docusaurus framework choice rationale
     - Advanced content structure decisions
     - Technology stack for advanced concepts
     - Integration patterns between Gazebo and Unity
     - Advanced physics, synchronization, and sensor fusion research

  3. Created data model (data-model.md) defining:
     - Advanced digital twin educational content entities
     - Advanced chapter and concept structures
     - Advanced code examples and learning objectives
     - Synchronization protocols and sensor fusion models

  4. Developed quickstart guide (quickstart.md) with:
     - Setup instructions for advanced content
     - Directory structure for advanced chapters
     - Configuration examples for Gazebo/Unity integration
     - Deployment instructions for GitHub Pages

  The plan aligns with all constitution principles and is ready for the tasks generation phase.
outcome: |
  Complete implementation plan created for Advanced Digital Twin Integration module with all required artifacts: plan, research, data model, and quickstart guide. All constitution principles validated and project structure defined for Docusaurus-based advanced content.
evaluation: |
  All planning criteria met:
  - Technical context fully defined with no unresolved clarifications
  - Constitution check passed with all principles satisfied
  - Research completed covering all advanced topics
  - Data model created with all relevant entities
  - Quickstart guide provides clear implementation path
  - All artifacts properly linked and structured
