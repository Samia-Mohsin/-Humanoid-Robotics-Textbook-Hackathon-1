## Response

Successfully created the feature specification for the Pipeline URLs Command Line Interface in branch `001-pipeline-urls-cli`. The specification includes:

- User stories for command line URL processing, validation, and configuration overrides
- Functional requirements covering URL acceptance, validation, processing, and error handling
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for user success rates, processing performance, and error handling
- Key entities: CommandLineURL, ProcessingResult, and CommandLineConfig
- Edge cases for various error conditions and boundary scenarios

The specification follows the template structure with all mandatory sections completed and is ready for planning and implementation. The specification is technology-agnostic while focusing on user value and business needs.
