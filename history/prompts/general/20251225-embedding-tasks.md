# Embedding Pipeline Task Breakdown

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for the URL Ingestion & Embedding Pipeline with:

- 50 detailed tasks organized across 8 phases
- Clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
- User story-based organization (US1-US4) following priority order
- Specific file paths and implementation details for each task
- MVP scope identified (User Story 1) for incremental delivery
- Task checklist format with proper IDs and story labels

The tasks are structured to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Ready for implementation following the Spec-Kit Plus workflow.
