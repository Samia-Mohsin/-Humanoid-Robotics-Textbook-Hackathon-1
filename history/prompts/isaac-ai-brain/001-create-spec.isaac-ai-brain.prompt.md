  /sp.specify Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

  ## Target Audience
  AI and robotics students

  ## Focus
  Perception, navigation, and training concepts for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac

  ## Chapters (Docusaurus)

  ### 1. NVIDIA Isaac Overview
  - Isaac Sim vs Isaac ROS
  - Role of simulation and synthetic data

  ### 2. Perception and Navigation
  - Visual SLAM (VSLAM) concepts
  - Sensor pipelines and Nav2 overview

  ### 3. Training and Readiness
  - Path planning fundamentals
  - Simulation-to-real concepts

  ## Success Criteria
  - Reader understands NVIDIA Isaac's role in humanoid AI
  - Reader can explain perception and navigation concepts

  ## Constraints
  - Docusaurus Markdown
  - Diagrams + minimal conceptual code
  - Fundamentals only

  ## Not Building
  - Full Isaac projects
  - Training pipelines
  - Hardware integration
response: |
  Created the complete specification for the NVIDIA Isaac module with:
  - User stories for each chapter (NVIDIA Isaac Overview, Perception and Navigation, Training and Readiness)
  - Functional requirements covering educational content about Isaac Sim/ROS, VSLAM, sensor pipelines, Nav2, path planning, and simulation-to-real concepts
  - Success criteria with measurable outcomes for student understanding
  - Quality checklist confirming all requirements are met
outcome: |
  Specification created successfully with branch 001-isaac-ai-brain, including complete user stories, requirements, and success criteria. Ready for planning phase.
evaluation: |
  The specification meets all quality criteria with no clarifications needed. All user scenarios are testable and requirements are clearly defined.
