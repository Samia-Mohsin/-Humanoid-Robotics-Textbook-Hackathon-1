## Prompt

generate tasks be concise

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for AI Agent with retrieval-augmented capabilities. The task breakdown includes:

- 36 total tasks across 6 phases (Setup, Foundational, 3 User Stories, Polish)
- User Story 1 (P1): Create Agent with Retrieval Tool - 6 tasks
- User Story 2 (P2): Answer Questions Using Retrieved Content - 6 tasks
- User Story 3 (P3): Handle Follow-up Queries - 6 tasks
- Dependencies: US2 depends on US1, US3 depends on US2
- Parallel execution opportunities identified for setup and model tasks
- MVP scope defined as User Story 1 completion
- All tasks follow checklist format with proper IDs, labels, and file paths

The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with proper dependency management and clear file paths for implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation phase
- 🧪 Tests: All 36 tasks validated with proper format and dependencies
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created with comprehensive implementation plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.implement to execute tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks enable incremental delivery with each user story building on previous

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all validation checks passed
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All task format and dependency checks passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute implementation with /sp.implement
