## Prompt

Retrieve stored embeddings and validate the RAG retrieval pipeline

Target audience: Developers validating vector-based retrieval systems
Focus: Accurate retrieval of relevant book content from Qdrant

Success criteria:
- Successfully connect to Qdrant and load stored vectors
- User queries return top-k relevant text chunks
- Retrieved content matches source URLs and metadata
- Pipeline works end-to-end without errors

Constraints:
-Tech stack: Python, Qdrant client, Cohere embeddings
-Data source: Existing vectors from Spec-1
-Format: Simple retrieval and test queries via script
-Timeline: Complete within 1-2 tasks

Not building:
-Agent logic or LLM reasoning
-Chatbot or UI integration
-FastAPI backend
-Re-embedding or data ingestion

## Response

Successfully created the RAG retrieval validation specification in the specs/001-rag-retrieval/spec.md file. The specification includes:

- User stories for validating Qdrant connection, executing query retrieval, and verifying metadata integrity
- Functional requirements for the retrieval system
- Key entities involved in the retrieval process
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Edge cases to consider during implementation

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification completeness.
