## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive implementation plan for FastAPI RAG integration (feature branch `001-fastapi-rag-integration`). The plan includes:

- Technical context and architecture overview
- Constitution compliance check
- Research document with decisions and alternatives
- Data models with validation rules
- OpenAPI contract specification
- Quickstart guide for implementation
- Implementation phases and tasks
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

The plan defines a FastAPI server with a query endpoint that integrates with the existing RAG agent, handles JSON request/response format, and includes proper error handling and health checks.
