## PROMPT_TEXT

```
Integrate backend RAG system with frontend using FastAPI

Target audience: Developers connecting RAG backends to web frontends

Focus: Seamless API-based communication between frontend and RAG agent

Success criteria:

FastAPI server exposes a query endpoint

Frontend can send user queries and receive agent responses

Backend successfully calls the Agent (Spec-3) with retrieval

Local integration works end-to-end without errors

Constraints:

Tech stack: Python, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK

Environment: Local development setup

Format: JSON-based request/response
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive feature specification for FastAPI RAG Integration (feature branch `001-fastapi-rag-integration`). The specification includes:

- User stories prioritized by importance (P1-P3)
- Functional requirements with acceptance scenarios
- Key entities and data structures
- Measurable success criteria
- Edge case considerations
- Quality checklist validation

The spec defines an API endpoint that allows frontend applications to send user queries to the backend RAG system and receive textbook-based responses, with proper error handling and JSON request/response format.
